# Lifescan

A simple scanner to create files readable by a game of life simulator

## How to use

Either execute directly (`$ ./lifescan`) or call `python3` explicitly (`$ python3 lifescan`)

Then follow the instructions printed to the terminal:
- move your mouse to the center of the cell in the upper left corner
- move your mouse to the center of the cell in the lower right corner
- move your mouse on a dead cell
- move your mouse on a live cell

Each time you have 5 seconds to do so (wait until the end of the countdown).

You should then indicate the width and height of your zone in terms of the number of cells.
The script will scan your screen to determine the state of each cell.

You can then export the scan to one or more of a few formats: Life 1.05, Life RLE, or plaintext


## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pyautogui (`pip3 install pyautogui`) ![](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui)

This format is basically the same as Life 1.05, but it is the one that was chosen by the LifeWiki itself to represent part of their pattern collection (1446 out of 2381 patterns are available as CELLS in addition to RLE). As supporting both formats was found quite trivial, it was decided to let the user choose.

### Life RLE (*.rle)
